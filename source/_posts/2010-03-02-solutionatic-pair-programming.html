<h1>Remote Pair Programming</h1>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://www.knowing.net">Larry O'Brien</a> and I set out to experiment with Remote Pair Programming.<br />He wrote about it on his SDTimes column: <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/WINDOWS__NET_WATCH_PROBLEMATIC_PAIR_PROGRAMMING/By_Larry_O_Brien/About_EXTREMEPROGRAMMING/34158">Windows & .NET Watch: Problematic pair programming</a><br /><br />We both liked the experience and would be rather happy to be able to work on a long term project that way (anyone hiring a remote pair?), but since his column gives more emphasis to the down sides, I thought I could write my point of view which is more on the up side ;)<br /><br />In general, I agree on the down sides but I got so excited with the advantages I saw that I would barely remember mentioning the problems if asked.<br /><br /><h2>The focus</h2><br />Working in pair forces you to focus on the work.<br />There is just no way you can be there and not be paying attention to whatever it is that you're supposed to do.<br />You get so focused in the work and the communication that the environmental noise that would otherwise annoy you just seem to disappear.<br />The speed in which you make progress can vary with a lot of factors but you are *guaranteed* to make some progress. All. The. Time.<br /><br /><h2>The challenge</h2><br />The fact that someone is watching your every step means that you keep challenging yourself to do things the best way you can.<br />You just can't look sloppy to your pair.<br />That means you avoid cutting corners or knowingly doing the wrong thing out of laziness or "to fix it later".<br />If you do something that feels wrong, you'll be called on it and have to defend your point, so, unless it's worth the trouble, you just work a bit harder and go for the right thing.<br /><br /><h2>The safety feeling</h2><br />You certainly feel more confident about every line of code you write.<br />Anything absurdly wrong will surely get catch by one or the other.<br />Even the small errors or typos get spotted really fast.<br />Sure, things can still be wrong, bugged or bad designed but the fact that the code was co-created and reviewed by at least one more person gives you a comforting feeling.<br /><br /><h2>The learning</h2><br />Working with someone else full time means you're continuously learning or at least exercising a different approach than your own.<br />You learn new tricks.<br />You get to defend your points.<br />And you question everything.<br />At the end of the day, you feel actively improving in many things.<br />Even your English, if you're not a native speaker ;)<br /><br /><h2>The loneliness</h2><br />Working remotely means you're almost always alone.<br />When your clients are in different countries, thousands of miles away, that's guaranteed.<br />It's just too expensive, time consuming and a tiresome task to travel for a meeting.<br />If there is something I miss every now and then it's having someone at close reach that I can share work stuff and work together.<br />Working in a pair was a comforting step in that direction.<br /><br /><h2>The results</h2><br />We shared the resulting project on Github.<br />If you'd like to poke around, it's available at <a href="http://github.com/carloslima/pasteme">http://github.com/carloslima/pasteme</a><br /><br />Overall, I consider it was a big win over the solo experience.<br />There is only one thing that could be much better and that's the IDE/Tools support.<br />While sharing a VM using VNC mostly worked, it didn't come close to the experience you get when you use Saros, Bespin or even Google Wave.<br />Being able to use all your monitors, drag windows around and organize it the way you like better would definitely improve the experience.<br /><br />Have a different opinion or want to suggest a different tool?<br />Just drop me a comment!</div>
